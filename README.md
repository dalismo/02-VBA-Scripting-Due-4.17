# Homework Name
> Stock Analysis - HODL

## Background on Homework
We were given data containing stock information from years 2014 across 2016 where through writing VBA scripts we needed to retrieve certain data points to calculate the yearly change, percent change and total stock volume for each ticker.

There was also conditional formatting that needed to be applied on the retrieved data. A positive yearly change for a ticker needed to be represented as green while a negative change needed to be in red

## Opinion
At first this project seemed like a challenge but once I started to understand the logic behind it made sense.
